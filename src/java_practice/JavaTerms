class -> keyword use to declare a class in java

public -> Keyword is an access modifier which represents visibility to all

static -> Keyword if we declare any method as a static. it is know as a static method.
          - The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method
          - The main method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require to create an object to invoke the main method, So it saves memory

void -> is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value

main -> represents the starting point of the program

string[] -> args is used for command line argument,

System.out.println() -> is used to print statement

Variable -> Is a container that holds the value while the java program is executed
            - A variable is assigned with a data type
            - Variable is a name given to a memory location
            - It is the basic unit of storage in a program
            - The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution
            - Variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location
            - In java all the variables must be declared before they can be used
